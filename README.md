I am a cross-platform client and audio-video developer, primarily using Rust and JavaScript.

In addition to Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript, I also use C#, Go, Kotlin, and C/C++, but my proficiency in these languages is very basic.

I specialize in web technology stacks and real-time audio and video. I am familiar with technologies such as Node.js, CEF, Web API, and WebAssembly. I have also participated in projects related to AV1 decoder implementation, Opus Celt decoder implementation, and WebRTC.
